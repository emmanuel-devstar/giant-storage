MODULAR THEME - INSTALLATION GUIDE
==================================

This is a clean, production-ready WordPress theme folder.

INSTALLATION:
1. Upload this entire "modular-theme" folder to:
   /wp-content/themes/modular-theme/
   
2. In WordPress Admin, go to Appearance > Themes

3. Activate the "Modular" theme

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- This theme requires ACF Pro plugin
- All ACF field groups are included in acf-json/ folder
- CSS files are already compiled (css/style.min.css)
- No build process required - ready to use

SAFETY:
- This is a separate theme folder - will NOT affect existing "modular" theme
- You can safely activate this without breaking the live site
- The old "modular" theme will remain untouched

VERIFICATION:
After activation, check:
- Blocks appear in Gutenberg editor (MODULAR category)
- All pages load correctly
- No PHP errors in error logs

If issues occur, simply switch back to the previous theme.
