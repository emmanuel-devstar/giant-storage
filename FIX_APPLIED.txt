==========================================
CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - THEME NOW WORKING
==========================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The theme was missing the vendor/ directory which contains
Composer autoload files required for the Configuration class.

FIXES APPLIED:
1. ✅ Added vendor/ directory (Composer autoload)
2. ✅ Made inc/setup.php resilient (checks if vendor exists)
3. ✅ Added class_exists() checks for Configuration class
4. ✅ Updated header.php with safe Configuration checks
5. ✅ Updated header-blank.php with safe Configuration checks

DEPLOYMENT:
The theme is now fixed. Upload the entire modular-theme folder
to your server and activate it. The site should work correctly.

VERIFICATION:
- vendor/autoload.php exists ✓
- Configuration class loads properly ✓
- All PHP syntax validated ✓
- Theme ready for production ✓
